# Tests `synapse-query.sh links` -- relations between nodes, derived from disk on
# demand rather than cached. There is no _relations.json on purpose: a few dozen
# nodes is kilobytes of edges, so a cached projection would be a fourth artifact
# to rebuild after every write, misleading silently once stale, in exchange for
# nothing.
#
# The relation type lives in prose (`- depends_on [[X]]`), which Obsidian's link
# graph cannot see, so these tests are also the contract on that line's shape: if
# the writer's Links format changes, the parser must change with it.
