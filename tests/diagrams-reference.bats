# Tests docs/synapse/generate-diagrams.sh -- the .mmd -> .png renderer and its
# --check mode. The point of --check is that a stale diagram is worse than a
# missing one: it is confidently wrong, and nothing about looking at it says so.
# synapse-bard has no diagrams of its own yet.
#
# Rendering needs mermaid-cli (which needs a headless Chromium), so the tests
# that actually render skip when mmdc is absent. The --check logic is pure
# shell/hashing and is tested unconditionally, because that is the part wired
# into CI-style verification.
