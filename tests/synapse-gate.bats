# Tests claude/lib/synapse/synapse-gate.sh -- the cluster-quality gate that flags a
# candidate cluster owning no vocabulary of its own before anyone pays to author
# its prose.
#
# No repo, no tree-sitter, no fakes: the gate reads a cluster-keyed vocabulary
# table and applies arithmetic to it, so every test here writes that table
# directly. That is the point of the seam -- what the gate decides is separable
# from how the counts were obtained.
