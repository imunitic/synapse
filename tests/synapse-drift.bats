# Tests `synapse-query.sh drift` -- what changed since each node's recorded commit.
#
# It complements `stale` rather than replacing it: `stale` re-hashes what a node
# already claims, so it is blind to *added* files by construction, and it reports a
# rename as a deletion. `drift` diffs `commit..HEAD`, so additions, deletions and
# renames are all visible, and the cost is one `git diff` per distinct baseline.
#
# Nodes are written by hand here rather than through synapse-write-node.sh, because
# these tests need to control `commit` exactly -- including the cases where it is
# absent or points at a commit that is not in this history.
