#
# It used to search the vault and inject matching node paths; measured against a
# real 52-node namespace it returned 50 of them for ~1057 tokens per turn, so the
# search was removed and the reminder kept. These tests therefore assert the
# opposite of what they used to: the same guards, but a SHORT constant line and
# no network call at all. The curl stub is still asserted -- as never being
# reached.
