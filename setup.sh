== Done with the automatable part. Manual steps remaining: ==

1. Edit ~/.claude/synapse.conf -- set OBSIDIAN_VAULT_DIR for this
   machine.
2. Install Obsidian.app, open your vault.
3. Settings -> Community plugins -> Browse -> install + enable:
   "Local REST API with MCP", "Headless Mode", "Iconic" (optional).
4. Run: ./setup-obsidian-mcp.sh <path-to-vault>
   (extracts the plugin's generated cert + API key, registers the
   MCP server, wires up NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS -- all automatic once
   the plugin is installed and has generated its data.json).
5. Optionally add Obsidian to login items and enable "Start headless"
   in the Headless Mode plugin settings, so it runs like a background
   daemon (see README).
6. Restart Claude Code so the new hooks/settings/MCP registration
   actually take effect for the running session.
