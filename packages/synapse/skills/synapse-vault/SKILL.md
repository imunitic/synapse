description: Synapse Vault is durable memory, and only its Index.md is ever auto-injected — every other note is pull-only. Load this BEFORE answering from your own reasoning about tooling behaviour, a past decision, a convention, a gotcha, or anything a previous session might have written down; and before creating or editing any note in the vault. Covers what to search with, and the vault-patch operations that silently destroy a note.

# Synapse Vault: search it first, and do not destroy it

Knowledge, not a procedure — like `synapse-node-format`. Nothing here tells you what to do
next; it tells you what is true about the store you are about to read from or write to.

## Only `Index.md` is pushed. Everything else is pull.

The SessionStart hook injects the vault's `Index.md` — folder layout and the namespace
catalogue. That is all. The other notes exist and are never injected, so the only thing standing
between you and a written-down answer is deciding to look.

**The failure this exists to prevent is not "not knowing". It is re-deriving, in the reply, a
thing the vault already says** — sometimes in three places at once. A wrong answer gets corrected;
a re-derived one is invisible, costs a turn, and quietly asserts that the memory system does not
work.

Search before you answer when the question is about:

- how a tool behaves, especially an option you have not used before
- whether a decision was already made, and why it went that way
- a convention, a naming rule, a threshold, a measured number
- anything that starts "I think it works like…"

```
synapse vault-search-text <query>          full-text, relevance-ranked, with match context
synapse vault-search --fields <f1,f2,...>  JsonLogic over frontmatter, tags, content, path globs
synapse vault-list                         when you already know roughly where it is
synapse vault-read <path>                  the whole note -- no partial/targeted read exists
```

`vault-search`'s JsonLogic filter and `--fields` projection both stop at frontmatter/tags/content/
path -- there is no `links`/`backlinks`/`unresolvedLinks` equivalent (no whole-vault wikilink index
exists yet), and `vault-read` always returns the full body, never one section on its own -- request
exactly what you need with `--fields` instead of over-fetching, and pull a specific section out of
`vault-read`'s output locally when that's all you actually need.

A search that returns nothing is a real result and worth one line in the note you then write —
a negative result cannot be rediscovered by searching for it.

## What silently destroys a note

Every item below returns success.

- **`vault-patch --heading "{title}" --replace` targeting the H1 replaces the entire document.**
  A heading target's `content` scope is "everything below this heading's own line, until the next
  heading at the same or shallower level" -- below a top-level H1 there is nothing shallower, so
  that scope is the whole note. To insert between the title and the first H2 — a status or
  metadata blockquote, the usual reason to touch that region — use **`--prepend` against the H1**.
  Never `--replace` there.
- **Heading targets are nested paths.** An H2 under the H1 is `"{H1 title}::{H2 title}"`; a bare
  `"{H2 title}"` fails with "target not found in {path}", which reads like the heading is missing
  rather than like the path is wrong. `synapse vault-doc-map <path>` returns the exact `::` paths
  (and every block id and frontmatter key too), so check it rather than guessing a path.
- **`--append`/`--prepend`/`--replace` splice `content` in exactly as given, with no relative
  heading-level translation.** Unlike some patch tools, a `#` in `content` is never adjusted
  relative to the target -- if you write `## Notes` in `content`, `## Notes` is what lands, at
  whatever nesting level you typed. `--append` always lands as the last thing in the target's own
  section (right before the next heading at the same level or shallower, or end of document),
  regardless of how deeply nested the immediately preceding content happens to be -- so a wrong
  heading level in your own `content` string is the only way to get this wrong, not an artifact of
  where in the section you're inserting.
- **`vault-patch --frontmatter <key>` only ever writes a scalar.** It delegates to
  `core.frontmatter.set` internally, so unlike a patch tool that re-serialises the whole YAML
  block, it *is* byte-preserving — every other line survives untouched. But its `content` is
  always written as a plain scalar, never a list, so it's the wrong tool for `tags` specifically.
  Prefer `synapse frontmatter set <path> <key> <value>` (or `--add-tag`/`--remove-tag` for `tags`;
  `synapse frontmatter get <path> <key>` reads one back) regardless — it's the narrower, one-field
  tool this exists for, without a read-then-write round trip through `vault-patch` for a single
  value. Neither tool handles a block-style value; fall back to reading the file, changing the one
  line, and writing the whole file back for that.
- **Block targets (`--block <id>`) only recognize a single-line block** — a line ending in
  ` ^{id}`. A multi-line block has no target grammar here at all; fall back to a heading target
  around it, or a disk-level edit.
- **The vault path is never hardcoded in a skill.** Every `vault-*` subcommand resolves it itself
  (`SYNAPSE_VAULT_DIR`, same tiered lookup `synapse.conf` uses) — pass a vault-relative path, never
  an absolute one you constructed by hand.

## Verify with a structural invariant, not by re-reading what you wrote

Re-reading the region you just changed can only confirm the change landed. It is silent about
everything else the operation touched, which for a destructive edit is the entire question.

Count the H2s (`awk '/^## /' file`) or compare the byte size against what you read. **A
verification that cannot fail in the direction you are worried about is not a verification.**

## If you do destroy something

`synapse-hook db-sync` auto-commits every vault edit, so the intact version is one
`git show <sha>:<path>` away in the vault's own git history. That hook is a vault-wide undo for
destructive tool calls, not merely a record of intentional edits.

## Tagging is part of writing a note, not a separate pass

Every note-authoring command (`synapse-note`, `synapse-design-note`, `synapse-task-note`) applies tags as one of the steps in creating or substantially updating a note. There is no separate tagging pass or command — `/synapse-vault-tidy`'s recategorization signal reads tag data, it never writes it.

The vocabulary is `synapse-tag-vocabulary.conf` — one tag per line, `#`-comments allowed, agent-maintained but freely human-editable. It resolves with the same tiered lookup `synapse-projects.conf` uses: first `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/synapse/synapse-tag-vocabulary.conf` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, else `~/.config/synapse/synapse-tag-vocabulary.conf`, then `~/.claude/synapse-tag-vocabulary.conf` — read whichever of those exists first. If none exists yet, create it fresh at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/synapse/synapse-tag-vocabulary.conf` when `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, else `~/.config/synapse/synapse-tag-vocabulary.conf` if `~/.config` already exists as a directory, else `~/.claude/synapse-tag-vocabulary.conf` as the final fallback. It lives outside the portable Synapse package, same as `synapse-projects.conf` — never committed there, never copied between machines.

Before adding a tag to a note, read the conf and prefer an existing entry over minting a new one. Add a new entry only for a genuinely new concept the existing vocabulary doesn't cover, and append it to the conf when you do. A note's tag set is agent-owned working content: a command may add or remove a tag freely, including one a human added by hand — there is no special protection that would block reconsidering it.

Tagging many existing notes at once (a backfill) should be rare to the point of not recurring — every note created through the authoring commands above is tagged inline as part of being written, so a vault only ever needs a backfill once, for notes that predate tagging being wired in at all. If one is ever needed anyway, resolve tags mechanically first: title text, folder path, and frontmatter (`task_id` prefix, `project` field) matched against the vocabulary settle the large majority of notes with no content read at all. Read a note's body only when those signals don't already resolve to at least one vocabulary tag. A full `vault-read` on every note in a large backfill spends session context on a decision cheap signals usually already make.

## The graph side of the vault

`synapse/{repo}@{branch}/` is not free-form notes. Nodes are written by `synapse write-node`
and regenerated by the `synapse-node` skill — never hand-edited, because the writer computes
`sources` hashes, `sources_digest` and the `## Sources` mirror, and a hand edit desynchronises
them. `_profile.txt` and `_manifest.tsv` are human-readable and may be edited directly. The
machine-only artifacts -- `_index.bin`, `_refs.tsv`, `_tags_cache.bin` -- are not here at all: they
live in `~/.cache/synapse/work/{repo}@{branch}/`, because they are derived, rebuildable and large,
and the vault is version-controlled.
