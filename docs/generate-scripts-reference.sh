# Generates docs/scripts.md from the header block of every claude/bin/*.sh.
#
# Usage: docs/generate-scripts-reference.sh [--check]
#
#   --check  exit 1 if docs/scripts.md is out of date, without writing it.
#            Wired into the test suite, so a stale reference fails visibly
#            instead of quietly describing a script that has moved on.
#
# The header block is the same text each script prints for --help, so there is one
# source of truth rather than a doc that has to be remembered. Extraction stops at
# the first non-comment line: the block runs from the `# Usage` line to `set -e`.
#
# THE MARKER IS `^# Usage`, NOT `^# Usage:`, and the difference already cost a
# broken page. A header cannot find the marker produces TWO defects at once, both
# of which render as perfectly plausible markdown: the prose pass never stops, so
# the usage lines are absorbed into the paragraph, and the help pass never starts,
# so the fence comes out empty. `synapse-identity.sh` says
# `# Usage (sourced, never executed):` -- it is sourced rather than run, so the
# parenthetical is real information -- and against a `^# Usage:` marker it
# rendered exactly that way. A missing marker is now a hard error rather than a
# quietly malformed section; see `validate` below.
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok (or up to date), 1 out of date with --check or a header the
# marker cannot find, 2 usage error

Generated from the header block of each script by `docs/generate-scripts-reference.sh`
— the same text the script prints for `--help`. Do not edit by hand; run the
generator, or `--check` it, which the test suite does.

Design rationale is not here: see [synapse-graph.md](synapse-graph.md) for the Graph these
scripts build and why they exist at all, and [synapse-vault.md](synapse-vault.md) for
the Vault that hosts it.
