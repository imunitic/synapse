Create a note in Synapse Vault with the title and options, list existing notes, or search existing notes: $ARGUMENTS

## Argument parsing

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `--list` (or starts with `--list`) → **list mode**: see "List mode" below, skip note creation entirely.

If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `--search` → **search mode**: see "Search mode" below, skip note creation entirely. This is also the mode to reach for programmatically (not just when the user explicitly asks to search) — per the Synapse Vault CLAUDE.md instructions, linking to an existing note is the highest-priority step before creating a new one, so run a search here before every bare-mode note creation, not only when a search is requested outright.

Otherwise, split `$ARGUMENTS` on `--task`:

- If `--task` is present → **task mode**: scaffold the note as a tracked task, following the `synapse-task` skill's conventions. Task notes always live under `tasks/`.
- Otherwise → **bare mode**: create an empty node (title + frontmatter only). Which category folder it lands in is resolved from `Index.md`, per "Choosing a category (bare mode only)" below — not a fixed set.

The title is everything before `--task` (trimmed). Example:

- `/synapse-note "My idea"` → bare note titled "My idea"
- `/synapse-note "proj-035 — Implement Foo" --task` → task note titled "proj-035 — Implement Foo"

In task mode, also attempt to extract a task ID from the title by matching a `{prefix}-\d+` pattern (letters, a hyphen, then digits). Use it as `task_id` in frontmatter.

If no match is found, **don't just leave it blank** — see "Resolving a missing task ID" below before proceeding.

## List mode

Use `mcp__obsidian__search_query` with the JsonLogic query `{"var": "frontmatter.task_id"}` — this returns every file that has a `task_id` set, along with that file's `task_id` value as `result`. For each match, also read the file's `status` and `title` (either via a second query `{"var": "frontmatter.status"}` / `{"var": "frontmatter.title"}`, or via `mcp__obsidian__vault_read` on the handful of matched files — whichever is fewer round-trips for the count involved).

Categorize:
- **Prefixed notes**: `task_id` matches `{prefix}-\d+`. Group by the distinct prefix found (whatever
  prefixes actually appear — don't assume a fixed set). Within each prefix, split further into:
  - **Open**: `status` is `TODO`, `IN-PROGRESS`, or `REVIEW` (or missing — treat as open)
  - **Closed**: `status` is `DONE`, `CANCELED`, or `CANCELLED`
- **Other notes**: no `task_id`, or one that doesn't match `{prefix}-\d+`

Sort each prefix group's notes numerically by task id (`{prefix}-9` before `{prefix}-10`); sort other notes alphabetically by title. Report one section per prefix found — "{prefix} notes — open", "{prefix} notes — closed" — plus "Other notes", each line as `{task-id or filename} — {title} [{status}]`. Omit a section header if it has zero entries. End with a total count.

Do not modify any files in list mode.

## Search mode

Everything after `--search` (trimmed, quotes stripped) is the query.

1. Run `mcp__obsidian__search_simple` with the query — this gives full-text relevance-ranked matches with context, the closest equivalent to a title/body search.
2. If the query looks like it's targeting metadata specifically (a tag, a task ID, a status value) rather than free text, also run `mcp__obsidian__search_query` with an appropriate JsonLogic filter (e.g. `{"==": [{"var": "frontmatter.task_id"}, "proj-032"]}`).
3. Report matches as `{title} — {file path relative to vault root}`, deduped across both. If nothing matches, say so plainly — the caller (agent or user) needs a clear "no existing note" signal to proceed with `--task`-less creation.

Do not modify any files in search mode.

## Resolving a missing task ID (task mode only)

Triggered when `--task` is given but the title doesn't match `{prefix}-\d+`.

The known project/prefix pairs live in a plain local file named `synapse-projects.conf` (one
`project-name=prefix` line each) — read/appended with the Read/Edit tools, not the `obsidian`
MCP server, since it's outside the vault. It is deliberately **not** part of the portable
Synapse package and never copied between machines, so contexts that shouldn't mix (e.g.
personal vs. work projects) never end up in the same file. It's self-managed — this command appends
newly resolved pairs to it — but also plain text, so the user can add, fix, or remove a line by hand
at any time.

Resolve *which* file that is with the same tiered lookup every `synapse-*.conf` file uses: first
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/synapse/synapse-projects.conf` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, else
`~/.config/synapse/synapse-projects.conf`; then `~/.claude/synapse-projects.conf`. Read whichever of
those exists first. Append a newly resolved pair (step 5 below) to that same file; if neither exists
yet, create `~/.claude/synapse-projects.conf` — today's default, unchanged for anyone who has never
touched an XDG config directory.

1. Identify the current project from context: the repo's `CLAUDE.md` (title/"About" section) or
   `git remote`.
2. Check the resolved `synapse-projects.conf` for a line whose project name matches (loosely —
   case/whitespace-insensitive). If found, use that prefix directly — no need to ask.
3. If the file doesn't have it yet, fall back to deducing from the vault itself (useful the first
   time this runs, or for a project whose notes predate this file): `search_simple` for the
   project/repo name across existing notes, and/or `search_query` on
   `{"var": "frontmatter.task_id"}` to see which prefixes exist, then check whether any of those
   prefixed notes reference this project. If exactly one prefix confidently matches, use it.
4. If nothing confidently matches (new project, or an ambiguous/multiple match), ask the user
   directly: "What's the project prefix for this task?" — plain free-text, not a multiple-choice
   list. Don't offer or hint at any other project's prefix as an option.
5. Whenever step 3 or step 4 resolves a pair not already in the conf file (including a fresh
   `project-name=prefix` line matching what was just deduced or asked), append it — so the next task
   for this project resolves from step 2 without a search or a question.
6. Once the prefix is known, find the next number: run
   `mcp__obsidian__search_query` with `{"var": "frontmatter.task_id"}`,
   filter the returned `result` values client-side for ones matching
   `{prefix}-\d+`, take the highest number found, add 1. If none exist yet
   for that prefix, start at 1.
7. Format the new task ID **zero-padded to 3 digits** (`{prefix}-001`, `{prefix}-030`,
   `{prefix}-037`, ...), matching the org-roam-era convention — widening
   naturally past 3 digits if a prefix ever needs it.
8. **Prepend the resolved task ID to the title itself** — the final title
   becomes `{task-id} — {original title}` (em dash). Use this same final
   title for both the `title` frontmatter field and the `# ` heading, and
   use the resolved task ID for `task_id`. Don't let the frontmatter task
   ID and the visible title disagree.

`/synapse-design-note`/`/synapse-task-note` read the same conf file directly for the same reason —
they don't duplicate this resolution logic, just this file.

## Choosing a category (bare mode only)

Task mode always uses `tasks/` — skip this step entirely in task mode.

In bare mode, ask the user which category the note belongs to. Read
`Index.md`'s folder list first — every top-level folder listed there
except `designs`/`tasks`/`synapse` (structurally fixed, not a bare-mode
destination — see `synapse-claude.md`'s Folders bullet) is a candidate
category, offered with that folder's own `Index.md` description as the
option's description. Don't hardcode a fixed option set: a fresh vault's
`Index.md` lists `research`/`scratchpad`/`inbox` (see
`claude/Index.md.template`), but a vault owner's own `Index.md` may have
renamed or restructured these, and whatever it currently says is what gets
offered.

Resolve this to a `category` matching the folder name exactly as
`Index.md` currently spells it, before moving on to the creation steps
below. No project-slug question is needed here — Obsidian filenames are
the title itself, not a slug-prefixed timestamp, so there's no separate
namespacing concern to resolve. The note always lands flat at
`{category}/{filename}.md` — never inferred into a subfolder such as a
triage/priority one a vault owner might maintain by hand (e.g.
`inbox/{high,medium,low}/`, per that folder's own `Index.md` description);
sorting a note into one of those, if a category has one, is never an
agent's call to make.

## Resolving the project folder (task mode only)

Task notes are grouped one level deeper by project, `tasks/{project}/{filename}.md` — see
`Index.md`'s `tasks/` section. The prefix (`ecs`, `sb`, ...) is not itself the folder name — it
names the *task*, not the *project* — so resolve what project it belongs to, regardless of how
the prefix became known (matched from the title, resolved in "Resolving a missing task ID" above,
or supplied directly by a caller like `/synapse-task-note`):

1. Reverse-lookup the prefix in the resolved `synapse-projects.conf` (same tiered lookup as
   "Resolving a missing task ID" above) — find the line whose value after `=` equals the prefix;
   its key is the project name.
2. If no line matches, check `Index.md`'s `tasks/` section, which documents the prefix-to-project
   mapping directly (e.g. `ecs-NNN` → `eon`).
3. If still unresolved (a genuinely new prefix with no mapping anywhere), ask the user for the
   project name and append `{project-name}={prefix}` to the conf file — so the next task note
   under this prefix resolves without asking.

## Creating the note

1. Sanitize the title into a filename: replace filesystem-illegal
   characters (`/ : * ? " < > |`) with `-`, collapse repeated whitespace.
   No timestamp prefix, no project-slug prefix — the filename is just the
   (sanitized) title.
2. Fetch machine local time: `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'` — never use inferred
   time. Use this for the `created` frontmatter field.
3. Build the file content:

   **Bare mode:**
   ```
   ---
   title: "{title}"
   created: "{now}"
   ---

   ```

   **Task mode:**
   ```
   ---
   title: "{title}"
   created: "{now}"
   task_id: {task-id}
   status: TODO
   last_updated: "{now}"
   ---

   # {title}

   ## Notes

   ```
4. Write it with `mcp__obsidian__vault_write`. Task mode: path
   `tasks/{project}/{filename}.md` (project resolved in "Resolving the
   project folder" above). Bare mode: path `{category}/{filename}.md`
   (category resolved above).

## Confirm

Report the file path back to the user.

- Bare mode: note that the note is intentionally near-empty.
- Task mode: note the task ID extracted or resolved, and remind the user
  to populate the `## Notes` section and checklist before starting work,
  per the `synapse-task` skill.
