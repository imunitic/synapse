# Writes every node that has both a path list and an authored body. Step 2 of a
# scripted /synapse-init.
#
# Usage: synapse-push-nodes.sh [NN ...]      (default: every staged or authored node)
#   Work dir: $SYNAPSE_WORK_DIR, default ~/.claude/synapse-work/{repo}@{branch}/.
#
# Reads  $SYNAPSE_WORK_DIR/lists/NN.txt + NN.title   (from synapse-build-lists.sh)
#        $SYNAPSE_WORK_DIR/b-NN.md                   (authored per node, see below)
# Calls  synapse-write-node.sh once per node.
#
# Each b-NN.md carries its own one-line summary in frontmatter, so everything
# authored about a node lives in one file:
#
#     ---
#     summary: One line differentiating this node from its siblings.
#     ---
#
#     ## Summary
#     ...
#
# The frontmatter is stripped before the rest is passed on as the node body, and the
# summary becomes the node's `summary` field. A node without one is an error rather
# than a default, because the index bullet has nothing to say without it.
#
# Note for agent callers: needs the sandbox disabled (localhost REST API).
