# `callers` is a one-line dispatch into claude/lib/synapse/synapse-callers.sh, ahead of
# this script's vault/namespace preamble -- see that file's header for why, and
# for the rest of its usage and rationale.
#
# `symbol` and `callers` differ in scope, not technique. `symbol` is scoped to
# one node's sources and re-hashes them on every call, so it answers "within this
# subsystem" and costs O(node sources); `callers` is repo-wide over a precomputed
# index, so it answers "anywhere" and costs one pass over a text file.
#
# `symbol` is a name-based, not type-resolved, lookup backed by a per-project
# tags cache ($SYNAPSE_WORK_DIR/_tags_cache.json, default
# ~/.claude/synapse-work/{repo}@{branch}/) kept current as a byproduct of node
# build/regeneration, with any file the cache is missing tagged lazily on the
# spot. Set SYNAPSE_DISABLE_SYMBOL_CACHE (any value) to disable entirely --
# see docs/synapse-graph.md's "Exact-symbol lookup" section for the full design.
#
# That cache sits beside the work dir rather than in the vault because it is
# derived, disposable and large: at large-repo scale ~942 MB against _index.json's
# 26 MB, and the vault is version-controlled, so every rebuild would commit a
# fresh copy of it into the vault's history. Deleting it costs one re-tag.
#
# `stale` re-hashes what a node claims; `drift` diffs its recorded `commit` against
# HEAD, so only `drift` sees added, deleted and renamed paths. Neither pulls.
# When to use which, and why any of this is a script: docs/synapse-graph.md.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - ran successfully. Empty output means clean for every reporting subcommand:
#       `stale`, `drift`, `grounding` and `links --check`. `drift` prints context
#       (commits behind, commits since baseline) only alongside a finding, so its
#       silence means the graph matches the worktree rather than that it gave up.
#   1 - could not run (missing dependency, no vault, no namespace, remote
#       mismatch, unknown node). Treat as "no information", never as "clean".

#
# Absence is "no namespace for this repo", which is exit 1 here -- "could not

# Verifies each node's `grounded_in` evidence: re-slice the recorded range and
# compare its sha256 against the stored one. Silence means every grounding still
# matches, so the prose resting on it has not been undercut.
#
# A pure line shift -- something inserted above the range -- would otherwise
# report every grounding in the file as broken, which is the fastest way to make
# a check worth ignoring. So a mismatch triggers a search for a same-length span
# elsewhere in the file whose digest matches: found means `moved`, which is
# mechanically fixable and needs no reading; not found means `changed`, which is
# a claim to re-check. That distinction is the whole value of the subcommand.
# Prints one node's recorded groundings as `path<TAB>lines`, so a regeneration can
# rebuild the `<!-- grounded_in: ... -->` directives it needs to re-emit. Without
# this the round trip loses them silently: they live in frontmatter, and `body`
# returns prose, so writing a recovered body back would drop every grounding.
# --- links: relations between nodes, derived rather than cached --------------
# Relations are node-scale, not file-scale: a few dozen nodes and a couple of
# hundred edges is kilobytes, derived from disk in about a tenth of a second. So
# there is deliberately no cached `_relations.json` -- a fourth derived artifact
# would need rebuilding after every write and would mislead silently once stale,
# and caching buys nothing when derivation is already free.
#
# Reads node files from disk. That is the infrastructure case, not note content:
# the question is what the graph asserts about itself, and the API cannot answer
# it. Obsidian's link graph is untyped, so a relation written `- depends_on [[X]]`
# is prose to it -- exactly queryable via `in` on `content`, but one request per
# question and no transitive or aggregate answers at all.

# relation<TAB>target for one node file, prefixed with a source column when a name
# is given. The whole-graph walks fan this out over every node; the outbound case
# reads a single file, because a node's own links live in its own file and deriving
# all of them to filter for one is 48 reads to answer with 1.
