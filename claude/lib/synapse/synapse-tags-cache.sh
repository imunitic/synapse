#!/bin/bash
# Keeps a project's synapse-tags.sh output cache current for a given set of
# files, re-tagging only what changed and doing so in parallel when several
# files need it. Shared by node build/regeneration (piggybacked on the same
# per-file hash comparison it already performs) and synapse-query.sh's
# `symbol` subcommand (lazy backfill on a cache miss). See docs/synapse-graph.md's
# "Exact-symbol lookup" section for the full design and the measured cost of
# a cold, fully-uncached run.
#
# Usage: synapse-tags-cache.sh --repo-root <path> --cache <_tags_cache.json path> --paths <file>
#   --paths  file of repo-relative path<TAB>current-git-hash lines, one per
#            file the caller wants current in the cache (a node's `sources`,
#            typically -- the caller already has both path and hash).
#
#   Tagging is BATCHED, one `synapse-tags.sh --paths` invocation per chunk
#   rather than one per file: CLI startup and grammar load are nearly all of
#   the per-file cost, measured at 0.076s for 200 files in one invocation
#   against 2.543s for 200 invocations across 12 workers. A hub node's 800
#   sources are a handful of calls, not 800.
#
#   Parallelism: xargs -P over the chunks, capped at nproc/sysctl -n hw.ncpu
#   (falls back to 4). Each worker writes its own raw batch output to a private
#   temp file; a single sequential jq pass afterward attributes those to paths
#   and merges them into the cache. No worker ever writes the shared cache file
#   directly.
#
#   A file with no usable grammar is still recorded, as `unsupported: true`
#   with empty tags, so it isn't silently re-attempted on every call. That is
#   a distinct outcome from "checked, symbol not present" -- callers must
#   report it as such, never as a plain non-match. In batch output the two are
#   told apart by shape: an unparseable file is absent entirely, while one that
#   parsed to nothing still gets its path line.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - cache is current for every requested path (already-current paths need
#       no work; this is also the outcome when nothing needed tagging at all)
#   1 - usage error, missing dependency, or the cache could not be read/written

# tree-sitter echoes back ARE the cache keys -- no re-derivation, and nothing
# for a path containing a space to be split on. That is what the previous

# --- sequential join: ONE jq pass attributes the batch and merges it --------
# Batch output is attributable by shape: an unindented line is a path, and the
# tab-indented lines under it are that path's tags. A file tree-sitter has no
# grammar for is absent from the output entirely, whereas one it parsed and
# found nothing in still gets its path line -- verified against the real CLI,
# and the distinction is the whole basis for `unsupported` here. Recording it
# is what stops an unparseable file being re-attempted on every single call.
#
# jq does the attribution rather than a shell loop for the usual reason: a loop
# would be one process per path, which is the cost the batching just removed.
