# Removes Synapse namespaces whose branch was deleted upstream, and reports the
# ones it cannot decide about. The only destructive tool in Synapse, which is why
# it is a command you run rather than a hook that fires: these are notes in a
# permanent vault, and the system should not delete them on inference.
#
# Usage: synapse-graph-clean.sh [--dry-run]
#        synapse-graph-clean.sh --help
#
#   --dry-run  report what would be removed, delete nothing.
#
# Operates on the repo containing $PWD, across every branch's namespace for it --
# not just the branch checked out now.
#
# What it does with each `synapse/{repo}@{branch}/` namespace:
#
#   remove  the branch had an upstream and it is gone -- merged and deleted, the
#           case this exists for. `git branch -vv` shows it as `[origin/x: gone]`.
#   report  the branch is absent locally and no upstream can be confirmed. That
#           covers a never-pushed branch deleted by hand, and a branch whose
#           config went with it, which are indistinguishable after the fact.
#           Reported for a human to remove, never deleted here.
#   keep    anything else, including a branch that was never pushed and still
#           exists -- work in progress, whose namespace is in active use.
#
# A `git fetch --prune` runs first unless --dry-run: without it a deleted branch
# still has a local remote-tracking ref, every namespace looks alive, and the
# command silently does nothing.
#
# In a repo with no remote there is no upstream to consult at all, so the test
# falls back to whether the local branch still exists. Without that fallback the
# first run in a remoteless repo would classify every namespace as deleted
# upstream and wipe the lot.
#
# Deletion is on-disk rather than over the REST API, which would need one call
# per note. The vault's own git history (see synapse-db-sync.sh) is the undo.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - ran (removed something, or found nothing to remove)
#   1 - could not run (no vault, not in a git repo, missing dependency)
#   2 - usage error
