#!/bin/bash
# Writes one Synapse node into the vault: hashes every source path, computes
# sources_digest, records the baseline `commit`, builds the aggregated `## Sources`
# mirror, and PUTs the note via the Obsidian Local REST API.
#
# Usage: synapse-write-node.sh --title <t> --summary <s> --paths <file> --body <file>
#        synapse-write-node.sh --help
#
#   --title    node title. Used verbatim as the H1, and sanitized for the filename.
#   --summary  one line for the index bullet, stored as the `summary` frontmatter
#              field. Written for the index, not as the node's opening sentence.
#   --paths    file of repo-relative paths, one per line: every file the node covers.
#   --body     file holding the authored prose (## Summary / ## Crux / ## Links).
#              `## Sources` and the generated fences are added by this script.
#
# The body must not contain crux code. It points instead:
#
#   <!-- crux: crates/matcher/src/lib.rs 412-419 -->     slice these lines
#   <!-- crux: none -->                                  no single span carries it
#
# This script cuts the text out of the file, fences it with a language guessed
# from the extension, appends a `path:start-end` provenance line, and records
# `crux_path`/`crux_lines` in frontmatter. The path must be one the node claims
# and the range must be under 20 lines, or the write is refused.
#
# The body may also carry any number of grounding pointers — the evidence a
# summary rests on, typically a doc comment or a test:
#
#   <!-- grounded_in: src/main/java/Foo.java 10-14 -->
#
# These are recorded in the `grounded_in` frontmatter list as path + lines +
# sha256 of the sliced text, then stripped from the body: provenance, not
# display. Same path and range checks as the crux, with a 40-line cap.
#
# Writes to the vault over the Obsidian Local REST API on 127.0.0.1. Agent callers
# need the network sandbox disabled, or curl fails with exit 7 and no message.
#
# As a byproduct it refreshes $SYNAPSE_WORK_DIR/_tags_cache.bin (default
# ~/.claude/synapse-work/{repo}@{branch}/) for the node's sources, so
# `synapse-query.sh symbol` is a cache read. That file is derived and
# disposable, which is why it lives beside the work dir rather than in the
# version-controlled vault. Never fatal; SYNAPSE_DISABLE_SYMBOL_CACHE skips it.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - node written; prints "<file>\t<n> files\t<digest>"
#   1 - could not run (missing dependency, no vault, remote mismatch, PUT failed)
#   2 - usage error
#
# Design rationale lives in docs/synapse-graph.md, not here.

# --- grounded_in: the evidence a summary rests on ---------------------------
# `<!-- grounded_in: <path> <start>-<end> -->`, repeatable. Points at what the
# codebase asserts about itself -- a doc comment, a test name, an assertion -- so
# a summary can be traced instead of taken on faith. Provenance, not display:
# these are recorded in frontmatter and stripped from the body, because six
# groundings rendered as six code blocks would bury the prose a human came for.
#
# Only the digest of the sliced text is stored, never the text. That keeps the
# field small, avoids escaping multi-line code into YAML, and makes verification
# mechanical -- re-slice, re-hash, compare -- the same trick `sources_digest`
# uses. Digesting the slice rather than the whole file is the point: a file
# changing elsewhere leaves the grounding intact, which is a far sharper signal
