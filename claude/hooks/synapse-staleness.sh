# --- opportunistic correction --------------------------------------------
# Flagging `stale: true` says "something under this node changed"; it never says
# the prose is now wrong, and nothing ever goes back to check. This does, but
# only where the edit landed on evidence the node explicitly cites: the file its
# `crux` was sliced from, or a range it records in `grounded_in`. That narrowness
# is the whole design. Nudging on any edit to any of a node's files would fire
# constantly and be tuned out within a day; nudging only when cited evidence
# actually stopped matching fires rarely and means something every time.
#
# It is also free: this is the one moment the model has certainly just read the
# code, so no re-reading is asked for. Correctness accrues along the paths that
# get worked in, and dormant subsystems stay as vague as they were -- which is
# the right trade, since nobody is touching them.
#
# Kept dependency-free and self-contained, like the rest of this hook. The
# grounded_in parser mirrors synapse-query.sh's extract_grounded_in; the tests
# assert on the behaviour rather than the duplication.
