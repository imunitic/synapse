# UserPromptSubmit hook: on every turn in a repo that has a Synapse namespace,
# state that the namespace exists and name the tools that read it. One short
# standing line -- no search, no node list, no network. Set
# SYNAPSE_DISABLE_PROMPT_INJECTION (any value) to disable entirely.
#
# WHY A NUDGE AND NOT A SEARCH. This hook used to run the prompt through
# synapse-tokenizer.sh, build a regexp OR-pattern, POST it to the vault's search
# endpoint, and inject the matching node paths. Measured against a real
# 52-node namespace, the prompt "can you explain how BatchRunner dispatches work
# items" returned 50 of 52 nodes -- for ~1057 tokens, on every single turn.
#
# The cause was not a tunable: `[Ww]ork` matched 50 nodes because it matched the
# substring inside `framework`, which appears 1392 times across the namespace's
# `sources` lists. Word boundaries only brought the union from 50 to 25. One weak
# term OR'd into the pattern destroys the whole query, and an ordinary sentence
# nearly always contains one.
#
# It was also solving a problem that no longer exists. Discovery is now cheap and
# precise on demand: `_index.json` answers path -> owning node for ~15 tokens
# with nothing entering context, the tags cache answers symbol questions without
# opening a file, and `synapse-query.sh` projects exactly the field asked for.
# Those are pull, precise, and paid only when the question is about the codebase.
# The search was push, imprecise, and paid on every turn -- including on "commit
# and push". Reading the entire node map costs ~2500 tokens once, so the old hook
# overtook that after 2.4 turns and kept charging.
#
# What could not be replaced by pulling is the reminder itself. A SessionStart
# injection ages out of a long session once context is compacted; a per-turn line
# does not. So this keeps the habit-defeating half -- reach for Synapse before
# grep -- and drops the half that tried to guess which nodes mattered. The skills
# already say what to do with them.
#
# No network, no jq-over-REST, no tokenizer: filesystem and git only. Every exit
# path is a genuine no-op -- disabled, no prompt, not a git repo, no namespace
# for this repo, or a namespace belonging to a different remote.
